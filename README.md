[02:54.29] Listen to me with your eyes, I'm watching you from in the sky
[02:57.83] If you forget I'll fade away, I'm asking you to let me stay
[03:01.58] So bathe me in your magic light, and keep it on in darkest night
[03:05.21] I need you here to keep me strong, to live my life and sing along
[03:09.06] I'm lying with you wide awake, like your expensive poison snake
[03:12.85] You found me here inside a dream, walk through the fire straight to me
